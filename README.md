# 12 Days – 12 Projects

This repository documents my **12-day coding challenge**, where I build and publish **one complete project every day** to strengthen my fundamentals in web development and develop consistency through daily practice.

Each project focuses on solving a small, well-defined problem using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with an emphasis on clean code, clear structure, and practical learning.

## Challenge Goals
- Build consistency through daily coding
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving and DOM manipulation skills
- Maintain a public record of learning via GitHub

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
