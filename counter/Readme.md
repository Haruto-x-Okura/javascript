# 📝 Counter App

A simple web-based counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The app allows users to increase, decrease, and reset a numeric value while demonstrating core JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The counter value is displayed on the screen using an HTML element  
2. Buttons are linked to JavaScript event listeners  
3. Clicking:
   - **Increment** increases the value by 1  
   - **Decrement** decreases the value by 1  
   - **Reset** sets the value back to 0  
4. The updated value is rendered instantly in the UI using DOM manipulation
